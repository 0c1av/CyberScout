# CyberScout
The CyberScout is a Python tool for directory and URL enumeration. It uses a wordlist to discover hidden paths on a target website, reporting results like "found", "not found", or "forbidden". It supports proxies, basic authentication, and customizable timeouts, making it ideal for penetration testing.
